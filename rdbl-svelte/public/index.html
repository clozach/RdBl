                    I Love Life is a collection of songs that my mom wrote for
                    us back then. She drew on her own childhood, growing up in
                    Hawaii. She decided to share I Love Life with everyone's
                    kids, and it went on to became the favorite album of
                    thousands of children—many of whom are now grown, and who
                    want to share it with their own kids or grandkids.</font

                    To continue to celebrate and share I Love Life, we've made
                    it available in CD and downloadable formats. There's also a
                    booklet you can download and print out for your little
                    ones.</font
