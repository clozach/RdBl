    <h1>Re: Explicit Workflow</h1>

    <p>
      If you don’t have a documented workflow, you’d better have a fabulous
      internal vision for how you work, or insane luck in the behaviors
      department. Without a workflow, you might be able to harvest the cotton,
      but you’ll never be able to ship it across the globe, transforming at
      every port: seeds to fibers, fibers to threads, threads to cloth, cloth to
      died cloth, spools to T-shirts, T-shirts to printers, printers to
      wholesale, wholesale to retail, retail to resale, resale to landfill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, no one can manage that entire unclosed cycle (U vs O), but if
      your goal is to get from the raw cotton of your thoughts to the in-store
      jacket of a printed book you’re going to have to make it clear to yourself
      — crystal clear, and persistent, every day for the life of the project —
      exactly how you do what you do.

      If only I knew how to follow my own advice!!
