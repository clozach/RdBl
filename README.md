<details><summary>Why for RdBl? ðŸ¤¨</summary>
So, I was curious about the biochemical underpinnings of the [upstairs/downstairs model of emotional regulation](https://www.artitout.com/single-post/2019/04/23/The-Upstairs-and-Downstairs-Brain-Turning-Chaos-into-Calm) used by clinicians to [teach children](https://www.heysigmund.com/how-to-teach-kids-about-the-brain-laying-strong-foundations-for-emotional-intelligence-by-dr-hazel-harrison/) about the relationship between the cortex (upstairs) and the amygdala (downstairs). How much do we know about this, and how does that knowledge translate into practical advice? Through the pernicious magic of the Intermess, my curiosity led me to this academic jouranl article (shown in the screenshots above) titled, [The effects of stress exposure on prefrontal cortex: Translating basic research into successful treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289514000101).

This was exactly what I was looking forâ€¦but I couldn't read it. The Summary alone is so packed with terms I've never encountered before that they bury much of the meaning for a lay person like me, even one who _has_ dones some reading about the PFC and the amygdala, albeit, not much. It's not that I'm incapable of teaching myself the meanings of "basal ganglia" and "low affinity alpha-1 adrenoceptors". It's just that, as I'm not in a PhD program, I've no interest in building my knowledge here from the ground up. I want a way to digest what's in front of me enough to get the gist, and make it easier to learn the other stuff along the way.

Making matters worse were the links in [that summary](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352289514000101). Click on the one for "catecholamine release", for instance. Did you know what catecholamines were before you clicked that link? If not, do you now? No?! Exactly.

I found myself wishing that I could pause on each challenging term, do a bit of web research until I had a reasonable idea of how the term fit in with the topic at hand, and then (and this is the crucial part), _temporarily replace every instance of the term_ right there on the site where I found it. The basal ganglia are gizzard-like appendages to the amygdala, and they're notably analagous to the structures found in reptiles (at least, I _think_ that's true), hence the term "Lizard Brain". Look up at those screenshots again to see how I opted to rewrite the paragraph for myself. The phrase "basal ganglia" became "gizzardy lizard brain", which I find helpfully evocative. It might not work for you, but that's fine because RdBl would allow you to use "gangly bits at the base" instead, or whatever other turn of phrase helps you get enough quick meaning for entire sentences to suddenly flow in your mind, unhindered.

That's the goal, anyway.
